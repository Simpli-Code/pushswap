# pushswap
Here, I will briefly describe the selection algorithm for the push_swap project:

In my implementation, I used linked lists for sorting algorithm and an integer array for filtering the input for validity, so the algorithm can also be implemented with  arrays, if you adapt this algorithm with some modifications. After filtering and converting the input string to integers I stored each value in a separate node, and stored in a singly linked lists. Each node has the following fields:
