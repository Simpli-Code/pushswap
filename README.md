# pushswap
Here, I will briefly describe the algorithm that used for my push_swap project:

In my implementation, I use a linked list for sorting the numbers and an integer array for filtering the numbers for validity, so the algorithm can also be implemented with  arrays, if you adapt this algorithm with some modifications. After filtering the input for validity (checking if the input are valid integers or there are no duplication or the input is not sorted (numbers are not in ascending orders)) then I split and convert the input string into integers using my functions ft_split(); and ft_atoi(); then I store each value in a separate node in a singly linked lists (aka STACK A).

The goal is to sort the input (which are numbers between MIN INT AND MAX INT) in ascending order into STACK A.

To do so we are only allowd to use the following operations:

sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.

Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.

Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.

ss : sa and sb at the same time.

pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.

Do nothing if b is empty.

pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.

Do nothing if a is empty.

ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.

The first element becomes the last one.

rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.

The first element becomes the last one.

rr : ra and rb at the same time.

rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.

The last element becomes the first one.

rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.

The last element becomes the first one.

rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

After filling up the STACK A with random numbers that we received as input we have the above instructions to sort the STACK A, so in order to achive that we have to create another stack which will be called STACK B. Depending on the number of inputs or number of elements we receive, which will define our stack size, we will react with different methods to sort the STACK A. So in another words before we proceed with sorting we have to always check our stack size first. For example if we have two elements (stack size == 2) which are not sorted, we just need to swap them or if we have three elements (stack size == 3) we call our function sort_3_elements(); or sort_5_elements(); for sorting a stack size of 5, so if we have a stack size of up to 5 elements we call specific function to handle these cases, our sorting algorithm will be called when we have more than 5 elements in our stack.
