# pushswap
Here, I will briefly describe the selection algorithm for the push_swap project:

In my implementation, I use a linked list for sorting algorithm and an integer array for filtering the input for validity, so the algorithm can also be implemented with  arrays, if you adapt this algorithm with some modifications. After filtering 
and converting the input string to integers I store each value in a separate node in a singly linked lists.
